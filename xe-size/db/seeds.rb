Place your hands behind or to the side of your head. You will begin with your back on the ground. This will be your starting position.
Flex your hips and spine to raise your torso toward your knees.
At the top of the contraction your torso should be perpendicular to the ground. Reverse the motion, going only Â¾ of the way down.

With the bench perpendicular to your body, and while looking away from it, hold on to the bench on its edge with the hands fully extended, separated at shoulder width. The legs will be extended forward, bent at the waist and perpendicular to your torso. This will be your starting position.
Slowly lower your body as you inhale by bending at the elbows until you lower yourself far enough to where there is an angle slightly smaller than 90 degrees between the upper arm and the forearm. Tip: Keep the elbows as close as possible throughout the movement. Forearms should always be pointing down.
Using your triceps to bring your torso up again, lift yourself back to the starting position.
Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.", exercise_image: "http://www.bodybuilding.com/exercises/exerciseImages/sequences/344/Male/m/344_2.jpg")
e4 = Exercise.create!(name: "Body-Up", description: "Assume a plank position on the ground. You should be supporting your bodyweight on your toes and forearms, keeping your torso straight. Your forearms should be shoulder-width apart. This will be your starting position.
Pressing your palms firmly into the ground, extend through the elbows to raise your body from the ground. Keep your torso rigid as you perform the movement.
Slowly lower your forearms back to the ground by allowing the elbows to flex.

e5 = Exercise.create!(name: "Bottoms Up", description: "Begin by lying on your back on the ground. Your legs should be straight and your arms at your side. This will be your starting position.
To perform the movement, tuck the knees toward your chest by flexing the hips and knees. Following this, extend your legs directly above you so that they are perpendicular to the ground. Rotate and elevate your pelvis to raise your glutes from the floor.
After a brief pause, return to the starting position.", exercise_image: "http://www.bodybuilding.com/exercises/exerciseImages/sequences/2021/Male/m/2021_3.jpg")

e7 = Exercise.create!(name: "Chin-Up", description: "Grab the pull-up bar with the palms facing your torso and a grip closer than the shoulder width.
As you have both arms extended in front of you holding the bar at the chosen grip width, keep your torso as straight as possible while creating a curvature on your lower back and sticking your chest out. This is your starting position. Tip: Keeping the torso as straight as possible maximizes biceps stimulation while minimizing back involvement.
As you breathe out, pull your torso up until your head is around the level of the pull-up bar. Concentrate on using the biceps muscles in order to perform the movement. Keep the elbows close to your body. Tip: The upper torso should remain stationary as it moves through space and only the arms should move. The forearms should do no other work other than hold the bar.
After a second of squeezing the biceps in the contracted position, slowly lower your torso back to the starting position; when your arms are fully extended. Breathe in as you perform this portion of the movement.
Repeat this motion for the prescribed amount of repetitions.", exercise_image: "http://www.bodybuilding.com/exercises/exerciseImages/sequences/129/Male/m/129_2.jpg")

Jump over the bench, landing with the knees bent, absorbing the impact through the legs.
